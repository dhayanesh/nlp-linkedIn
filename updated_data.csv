"<p>Content : Whenever you find yourself slipping, remember everyone who underestimated you.

When you harness negative feelings and turn them into positive energy, you're going to get significantly further.

The Tom Brady effect, if you will.

So, when you're feeling down in the dumps or struggling to continue moving your business forward, do three things:

1. Reflect on Your 'Why':

Go back to the reason you started. Your core motivation is your anchor ‚Äì it can pull you back from the brink and give you a renewed sense of purpose.

2. Seek Out Constructive Feedback:

Reach out to a mentor, a peer, or your audience. Constructive criticism can be a powerful catalyst for growth.

3. Set a Small, Achievable Goal:

Sometimes, the big picture can be overwhelming. Break it down. Set a small, achievable goal and give it your all.

Remember, setbacks are not failures, they're just opportunities to come back stronger.

Push, grow, and let the doubt fuel your drive to succeed.

"When it comes to social media, most advice is outdated.

Here are 5 predictions about social media in 2024.

We're living in the most rapidly evolving digital landscape in history.

Yesterday's strategies are quickly becoming today's duds.

To stay ahead, you must look forward, not back.

Here are some future-forward strategies for success:

1. Embrace the Rise of AI-Driven Content:

AI isn't just a tool. It's becoming a collaborator. Use AI to analyze trends, generate ideas, and even create preliminary content drafts.

2. Prioritize Audio and Visual Experiences:

With the rise of video and audio platforms, it will be critical to create engaging content people want to see or hear. It's about an experience, not just sharing information. I'll be there in 2024.

3. Focus on Community-Led Growth:

Build communities, not just followings. Engage with niche groups, build spaces for discussion, and create a sense of belonging among your audience. Difficult, but worth it.

4. Deeper Authenticity:

Audiences are increasingly drawn to brands and people who show their true colors. 10 best Podcasts, 7 Best Books and 15 Best Ads content is going to tank in favor of real, authentic knowledge.

5. Utilize Predictive Analytics for Personalization:

Go beyond basic analytics. Use predictive analytics to understand what your audience might want in the future, so you can create highly personalized and relevant content.

In a world where social media is constantly reinventing itself, staying adaptable, and forward-thinking is key.

What are your predictions or strategies for the future of social media?

"Ever wonder why companies want you to come back to the office? 
 
Or spend all day at your desk? 

Me too.

Sure...I understand the camaraderie.

Or teamwork.

And some things are more easily done in person than virtually. I get that.

But here's something else I think:

Success is not about long hours in the office. Or sitting at your desk from 9 to 5.

It's about good ideas and sharp execution.

And sometimes, the best ideas come when you're away from your desk.

Like at the dinner table, on a run, or playing with your kids.

Spending time with family isn't just nice, it helps us think better.

Don't get stuck on the old idea that more hours at work means more success.

Try something different.

Spend more time living life, and you might find you're better at your job.

Maybe a new way to measure success is in the quality of our ideas, and how we execute them - not the quantity of our hours.

Your desk isn't going anywhere, but your life is.

Build life-work balance.

Not the other way around.

"9 Entrepreneurial Lessons from the Netflix documentary, 'Sly' about Sylvester Stallone.

1. Pursue your passion relentlessly:

""I am not the richest, smartest, or most talented person in the world, but I succeed because I keep going and going and going.""

2. Have a mindset of unbridled optimism:

""I believe any success in life is made by going into an area with a blind, furious optimism.""

3. Use rejection as a motivator:

""I take rejection as someone blowing a bugle in my ear to wake me up and get going, rather than a signal to retreat.""

4. Adaptability in the Face of Challenge:

""Every time I've failed, people had me out for the count, but I always come back.""

5. Build a network of loyal people who love you:

""I learned the real meaning of love. Love is absolute loyalty. People fade, looks fade, but loyalty never fades.""

6. Develop a high level of persistence:

""It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.""

7. Be a continuous learner:

""Remember the mind is your best muscle... Big arms can move rocks, but big words can move mountains.""

8. Don't let failure dictate your mind:

""Success is usually the culmination of controlling failure.""

9. Never stop trying to get better:

""I'm always looking for a new challenge. There are a lot of mountains to climb out there. When I run out of mountains, I'll build a new one.""

"People love to talk about goals. 
 
Big, grand ambitions, written down and dreamed about. 

But when it's time to go out there and hit those goals, there's a pretty sobering reality:

Progress is damn hard.

And this is why people quit.

I've seen more brilliant people give up simply because they lack the persistence to keep going day over day over day.

The grind of difficult progress just wears them down.

It's super disheartening.
But it's also a wake-up call.

Success is not a thing that ""happens"".

It's a process.

The most successful people I know have stayed the course, chipping away at their goals, never hoping for some ""overnight success"".

And it‚Äôs time that narrative becomes more common.

So, instead of idolizing the dreamers, instead, focus on the grit and tenacity that's required.

"Last week I attended an event with 10+ entrepreneurs doing $1M+ annually. 
 
Here are 5 cool lessons I learned:

1. Stay positive:

I didn't hear one complaint from any of the people I spoke with.

They were positive, excited, uplifting, and only expect to get better over time.

2. Have a bias toward action:

None of the people were Harvard-level smart.

They just continuously tried a bunch of stuff until they figured out what worked for them and then did more of that stuff.

3. Build self-confidence:

None of them were arrogant, but all of them had confidence in their own ability.

And it didn't come from an especially privileged upbringing.

In fact, most of the time it was the exact opposite.

Working through a difficult childhood showed them that they could do anything.

4. Be caring & kind:

Not a single person wanted other people to fail.

It was a group of cheerleaders, cheering on the other speakers, attendees, and any random person they came across.

Their enthusiasm was infectious.

5. Embrace failure:

Failure was not a dirty word.

If they ""failed"", they simply took notes, learned, tried something new, and kept going.

Resilience wins.

---

You don't need to go to an event like this to have success.

You just need to stay positive, take action, be confident in your ability, be caring and kind, and embrace failure.

"Stop trying to sell your product. 

Start solving problems for prospective customers.

Selling gets a bad rap because it's often seen as trying to ""convince someone to buy from you.""

But that's not how the best do it.

Instead, make your product or service so good at solving a problem that people feel like they've gotta have it.

Here are 7 steps that will help you sell your product or service:

1. Find the big, specific challenges your ideal customers are facing.

2. Design your product or service to solve those very specific challenges.

3. Use content to shine a light on the problem and use resources on your website to move the prospect along in their journey.

4. Inside the resources, highlight other customers just like them who worked with you to solve the same problem.

5. Ask them to fill out a form with a few simple questions to see if they're a fit for your business.

6. Jump on a call, and walk through how you think you could help based on what you know.

7. At the end, simply ask, ""Based on what I shared, do you think it would make sense to work with one another?""

You‚Äôll know you're doing it right when people start answering:

""Yes. How can I get started?""

"Entrepreneurs can be their own worst enemy. 
 
The biggest obstacle to their success. 

That's the danger of a fixed mindset.

It causes you to fear failure, stifle your creativity, and crush your potential.

So if you've ever thought, ""I suck at this"" - that's a fixed mindset in action.

What if you flipped it around to a stepping stone instead of a stumbling block?

Here's some advice on building a growth mindset:

1. Reframe Your Self-Talk:

We're often our own harshest critics. Pay attention to your inner voice and the way you react to failure and criticism.

2. Embrace the Power of 'Yet':

Adding this three-letter word to your vocabulary can be a game-changer. It's not that you can't do something; it's that you can't do it yet.

3. Dedicate Time for Self-Improvement:

Regularly setting aside time to learn something new reminds you that your abilities are not fixed but can be developed.

4. Surround Yourself with Growth Mindset Individuals:

The people you spend the most time with can influence your mindset.

Try to surround yourself with people who also have a growth mindset ‚Äî those who see challenges as opportunities, who grow in the face of setbacks, and who see effort as the first step to mastery.

Remember - the choice is yours:

Be trapped by your thoughts, or give your mind permission to embrace growth.

"Lots of people on LinkedIn talk about side hustles, but very few people actually tell you how to start. 
 
So, here's how you build a side hustle (while employed full-time):

1. Pick a topic you can talk about for 30 minutes unprepared

2. Create daily content sharing your knowledge

3. When people ask questions, DM & schedule calls.

4. Listen for common challenges during your calls.

5. Create a short video product to address those.

6. Send it to the folks you helped on those calls.

7. Ask for testimonials in exchange for it.

8 Add the testimonials to your website.

9. Charge $50 for your new course.

10. Start charging $250 for calls.

Now you have two revenue streams:

1. A simple coaching call ($250)
2. A simple digital video product ($50)

- Make the product your low-end item.
- Make the coaching call your high-end item.
- Use email automation to collect more testimonials.

If people can't spend $250, direct them to the product.

At the end of the product video, share a link to schedule calls.

And around the cycle goes.

If you sell one of each, each weekday, you'd make an extra $78,000 this year.

3. Health Issues:

Sitting in front of the computer for hours on end, eating rushed lunches, and the strain from continual stress crushes people's physical health.

The worse the company, the more they expect you at your desk, nonstop, and lack the resources to help keep their employees healthy and happy.

4. Lack of Fulfillment:

Ask yourself this honest question - are you working on something you genuinely care about?

Or just completing tasks to get a paycheck at the end of the month?

"It's easy to talk about goals.

To toss 'em up on the whiteboard & dream those big dreams.

But we get hit with a sobering reality when we roll up our sleeves:

Progress is extremely hard.

Suddenly we remember that it's easier to dream up grand goals than to stare at the gritty details of daily work.

And this is why people quit.

I've seen more brilliant people give up not because of their lack of ability, but because they lack persistence.

The grind of progress just wore them down.

It's pretty disheartening.

But it's also a wake-up call.

Success is not an event. Success is a process.

The most successful people I know have stayed the course, chipping away at their goals, never hoping for some overnight success.

And it‚Äôs time that narrative becomes commonplace.

So, instead of idolizing ""unicorn"" dreams, let's focus on the grit, tenacity, and progress that gets you there.

"How to make more money by talking to your customers. 
 
The 30-30-30 Method. 
 
Here's how it works: 

Step 1: Talk to Your Ideal Customers

Spend at least 30 minutes per week talking to your ideal customers about their problems.

This helps you build a business around their needs, not your assumptions.

Use discovery questions to understand:

- Technical pain
- Historical pain
- Financial pain
- Personal pain

Step 2: Solve Problems

Spend at least 30 minutes a day figuring out how to solve the problems your customers tell you about.

If you can get answers to the questions above, you have a treasure trove of information to work with.

Can you solve those challenges you learned about?

Step 3: Create content to highlight your solution

Spend 30 minutes a day writing content about the problems your target customers tell you about.

Keep their pain points in mind.

Then write content that speaks to prospects who have the exact same problem (and the same pain!).

Result:

If you can follow the 30-30-30 Method, you'll always be improving.

It's hard NOT to get better at your business by spending time with customers, creating unique solutions, and talking about them online.

Underscore the financial and personal pain you learned about.

Remember: People buy to solve their pain.

Now it's up to you to put it front and center.

That's not necessarily a bad thing. 
 
But if you‚Äôre building a business, you're missing a key demographic: 

People who don‚Äôt even know they have a problem (that you can solve).

These folks need to enter your orbit, but they don‚Äôt know it yet.

So it‚Äôs your job to show up for them in the right way.

To unlock this massive opportunity, it's important to understand the stages of the modern customer journey:

1. Problem Unaware: I don‚Äôt know I have a problem.

2. Problem Aware: I‚Äôm aware I have a problem. How do I fix it?

3. Solution Aware: I‚Äôm aware there are solutions, but not yours.

4. Product Aware: I‚Äôm aware of your product. Why are you the best?

5. Most aware: I want your product. Make me an offer I can‚Äôt refuse.

2. Burnout:

With the merging of home space and workspace, we are constantly 'on.'

This constant availability leads to chronic stress and burnout.

3. Health Issues:

Sitting in front of the computer for hours on end, eating rushed lunches, and the strain from continual stress crushes people's physical health.

The worse the company, the more they expect you at your desk, nonstop, and lack the resources to help keep their employees healthy and happy.

4. Lack of Fulfillment:

Ask yourself this honest question - are you working on something you genuinely care about?

Or just completing tasks to get a paycheck at the end of the month?

If you work for a bad company, there's never been a better time to start working on something of your own on the side.

Here are some observations I've made on my 4.5-year journey that I think are worth sharing: 
 
1. Slow & steady wins:

Building my brand over many years has been worth the wait.

I feel like I have a deep understanding of what people want to read, and the content that impacts them.

Hacking your way to fast growth means losing a lot of that.

2. Staying focused works:

Most people who follow me know that I don't often stray from my core competency.

I like to talk about social media growth, solopreneurship, and building online.

Being a ""familiar character"" has worked to my advantage.

People know what they're going to get each morning.

3. Positivity goes a long way:

There's a new crop of LinkedIn creators that grows through trolling, negativity, cruelty, making fun of other creators, etc.

I've tried my best to do the opposite.

Supporting other people, cheering on those in the arena, and remembering that everyone is going through something behind-the-scenes.

Be kind. You'll go farther.

4. Sharing a bit of myself isn't bad:

For the first 3.5 years or so, I never really shared anything about myself.

No pictures, no travel, no personal stuff.

Recently, I've started doing this bit by bit.

I was surprised to find that people enjoyed it.

I'm sure I'll do more in 2023 and 2024.

- Ask for feedback
- Collect testimonials
- Add a bit more to the product
- Re-release for a slightly higher price

Then I kept writing.

And pretty soon people weren't asking me about healthcare anymore.

They were asking me about social media.

And business.
And how to write.
And how to build stuff online.

So I pivoted on a dime and started talking about that stuff.

I hypothesized that most people would be at the beginning or intermediate stages of leveraging LinkedIn.

My hypothesis was that pricing should skew low to capture that audience.

Less than $300.


Hypothesis 2: Make it easy to buy, fast

I wanted to make it what I call, a ""Quasi-impulse"" buy.

Low enough to be easy to buy the first time they saw it, but high enough to earn significant revenue.

To make it a quasi-impulse buy, it probably needs to be less than $200.


Hypothesis 3: Driving word-of-mouth & affiliates would make it viral

Word-of-mouth and affiliate sales only make sense at a lower price point.

Noting hypothesis 1, the majority of users won‚Äôt feel comfortable referring friends to something incredibly expensive.

Drop to $150.


Hypothesis 4: #3 (above) will accelerate with global adoption.

Make sure to include PPP (purchase power parity).

This will incentivize purchases from other countries.

Those purchasers would be likely to enroll in the affiliate program, too.

Include PPP discounts.

----

The results?

Price: $150
PPP Discount: 20% to 60% by country
Students: 11,500
Revenue: $1.419M
Timeline: 18 months

"4 ways to make extra income in 2023 (that don‚Äôt involve 40 hours per week):


1. Start a coaching or consulting business

Why I like a service-based business:

Generally, easier and lower cost to get started.

Plus you can likely charge 2x to 5x what you make (hourly) at your 9 to 5 job.


2. Create a digital course

Why I like digital courses:

People can purchase the courses 24/7, plus you have the opportunity to create a nice affiliate program that drives even more sales.


3. Build a paid community

Why I like paid communities:

Building a space where people of similar interests can congregate improves your brand, builds trust, & deepens relationships.

This helps grow your audience and build your business.

Get community right and it's the most powerful of all of these (but the hardest).


4. Start a subscription email

Why I like subscription emails:

The scale is incredible.

As the customer base grows, the work effort generally remains the same, meaning that you make more money without much extra work.

"You should consider quitting your job in 2023.

Here are 10 reasons why:

1. The Internet:

There has never been a better time to start an internet business.

You have access to 4.9B potential customers.

Break your current earnings into weekly chunks.

Can you find enough people to pay you each week for your knowledge or services?

Likely yes.

Get to 60% or 70% of your current earnings before making a leap.

2. Your health:

During the pandemic, many people got significantly less healthy.

Now, we're back at work and also trying to play catch up on our health.

That's not a fun game to play.

Take 12 months and zoom in on your health with more free time.

3. Your family:

Your spouse/partner is getting older and your kids are growing up fast.

Are you going to be happy that you spent more time at the office, or built a business where you can spend the majority of your time with your loved ones?

4. Your Time:

Time moved slowly when I was a kid.

A little faster in my 20's. Then?

Bang. I'm 41.

I can't imagine spending the prime of my life missing my wife, not being able to explore the world or see my parents before they are gone.

5. Loyalty:

In case you've missed it, companies are laying folks off at a pretty rapid pace.

Newsflash: You're a line on a spreadsheet until the math doesn't work out.

The days of 30+ year careers at companies are over.

Employ yourself and you'll get the boss you deserve.

6. Leverage:

If you build a successful online business, you create incredible leverage.

You become harder to control. You can say no more. You can take time when you want.

You control the effort and how big you want to go.

You're the decision-maker.

7. Flexibility:

Want to take Johnny on a fishing trip?

Want to accompany your aging parents to Japan for their dream vacation?

No more ""Damn, my boss says no"" while telling your friends about the great work/life balance at your company.

Say yes to everything that matters.

8. Purpose:

When you were growing up, did you dream of sitting in a cubicle & talking to customers about some random integrated multi-platform functionality that will probably fail to IPO?

No.

Instead, choose a curious obsession and go find people who need what you're selling.

9. Joy:

We all think we want happiness, but what we really want is joy.

Happiness is fleeting moments. Joy means making an important impact during our lives.

By betting on yourself and aligning with a higher purpose, you give yourself the best shot of living a joyful life.

10. Regret:

Don't look back in 10 years and wish you got started earlier.

Could you fail? Absolutely.
Will you make mistakes? 100%

Will you recover and always be able to find a job again if you're talented? Definitely.

At least give it a shot in 2023.

"A 30-minute conversation led to a $2,243 piece of content.

Here's the story:

A few months ago, I had a 30-minute meeting with a friend of mine named Blake Burge to talk about improving his business's revenue.

Blake has a massive Twitter following and is an Excel wizard who creates helpful threads for other Excel users.

But, Blake was facing a challenge that other creators face:

He was getting in his own way turning attention into revenue.

He had been selling a $49 Excel course and was hardly getting any traction.

So I asked him to walk me through the most common way that someone becomes a customer of his product.

Here was his previous sales process:

Step 1: Prospect reads a Twitter thread of Blake‚Äôs

Step 2: Prospect moves from thread to website to download free Excel templates

Step 3: Prospect receives the free Excel template & is moved to an email sequence

Step 4: Prospect is pitched a $49 Excel course over several emails

Step 5: Purchase is made or the email sequence ends with $0

This math is extremely challenging.

Even if Blake gets 2,000,000 impressions on his thread, he might get 400 free template downloads.

From there, he‚Äôd be lucky if 10% (40) of those people opened it up and started the template.

Free products are easy to ignore because there is no skin in the game.

Of those 40 people, he might convert 1.5% for 0.6 customers or $29.40 per thread.

There‚Äôs no way that should be happening.

Want to learn how we fixed it and 76x'ed his average thread revenue?

"Should you quit and storm out of your 9 to 5?

Probably not. Here's what you should do instead:

1. Check your employee agreement

Can you work on a side hustle while employed?

It's always good to double-check your agreement with your employer first.

If you're good to go, next...


2. Embrace an obsession

Find something you're obsessed with an dive in.

When you love something, you rarely need external motivation.

You wake up each day with an intense desire to become the best in your specific obsession.

So ask yourself this:

‚ÄúWhat am I absolutely obsessed with? What could I research, break down, and share with the world daily, that would feel like play instead of work?‚Äù


3. Acquire unique knowledge

The best way to develop this unique knowledge is by putting maximum effort into exploring your obsession.

For example, there are a million ‚Äúproductivity experts‚Äù and books on building better habits.

But James Clear‚Äôs book, Atomic Habits, stands head and shoulders above the rest.

Why?

Because his obsession with habits led him on a unique journey all his own.

And out of that journey came unique knowledge like:

- Habit Stacking
- Plateau of Latent Potential
- The 3 layers of Behavioral Change

Nobody can compete with James, because in a world of boring academic and scientific studies, James translated his obsession into unique knowledge that only he has.


4. Build distribution

Study human psychology, marketing, and persuasion.

Don‚Äôt copy your competition.

Once you understand how to generate attention, set up a simple customer journey that increases awareness, trust, and relationships.


5. Scale using digital media

Take 30 minutes at the end of each day to observe what you accomplished or learned that day.

What can you share with your audience that's a uniquely specific learning to you?

Tell stories, use metaphors, show real word examples, share behind the scenes, challenge conventional thinking, etc.

Every piece of content works on your behalf for hours, days, and sometimes - weeks.

Classic pieces of content have lasted years or even decades. That's the power of media.


TL;DR

1. Check your employee agreement
2. Embrace an obsession
3. Acquire unique knowledge
4. Build distribution
5. Scale using digital media

No more chasing after the next big thing.

No grandiose desire to leave a mark on the world, or the need for external validation.

My goal was to redesign my life with more intention.

Here's what that meant to me:

- I didn't want to hustle 24/7.
- I didn't want to be in meetings all day.
- I didn't want to build the next unicorn.
- I didn't want to be featured on any lists.
- I didn't want to get the highest valuation.

Instead:

- I wanted to be able to travel wherever I want to, whenever I want to.
- I wanted to spend way more time with my friends and family.
- I wanted to spend my time working on things I enjoy.
- I wanted to stop doing things I don't like doing.

But, I knew that building this would require a new way to earn a living.

A much different way than I was accustomed to.

So I started writing on LinkedIn.

"Many people on LinkedIn dream of building an online business.

And why wouldn't they?

The potential to reach a global audience here is staggering.

But, behind the scenes - people struggle to turn a profit in the online world.

That's the harsh reality.

And it can feel like you're pouring time and effort into your online business without results.

And when others make it look easy, that's super frustrating.

But the truth is you could be a few steps away from flipping the script.

It might be as simple as not having the right strategy in place, or just making common mistakes that prevent you from seeing success.

The solution?

It's time to take a step back and reassess your approach.

Here are a few key steps to reorganize:

1. Re-identify your target audience & only create content that resonates with them.

2. Build a marketing funnel that guides your audience from discovery, to trust, to purchase.

3. Give people a reason to visit your site and build authority through a newsletter or podcast.

If you're banging your head against the wall trying to figure this out, read this article I put together:

Then, refocus and simplify.

You can get back on track.

Don't give up if you fail at first - with the right approach, you can get the traction you're looking for.

Good luck out there, everyone.",post165
"Here's an average day as the CEO of my one-person business:

- 6:00a: Wake up and enjoy coffee

- 8:15a: Publish social media content

- 9:15a: 60-90 minute walk with my wife

- 11:00a: Write my newsletter or social content

- 11:45a: Go out to eat or cook lunch at home with my wife

- 1:30p: Client meetings, business ideas, or work on products

- 3:30p: Wrap up the day by getting tomorrow's content prepped

"About 5 months ago, my business took a drastic downturn.

A perfect storm of things happened:

- Inflation kept increasing
- The market started falling
- Gas prices started going up
- People began getting laid off
- Summer meant less computer time

And, of course, I was trying to buy a new house.

Nothing is more stressful than going through that situation while business numbers are going down.

I started to feel a bit panicked but decided to do what I always do when something like this happens.

I ripped apart my old content creation and monetization framework.

And then, I rebuilt it from scratch.

- 7% increase in social media impressions
- 15% increase in website traffic
- 21% increase in revenue

"A few controversial things I believe about Solopreneurship.

1) It's not as difficult as you think.

I‚Äôm not saying it's easy to start building your own business.

I‚Äôm just saying that the core fundamentals are some knowledge, a landing page, a way to collect a payment, and the courage to talk about it daily.

-

2) You don't need to work 60-80 hours per week

Contrary to popular belief, the 24/7 successful hustle bro is a myth.

I've seen it firsthand.

- Burnout
- Fake riches
- Happy outside, sh*tty inside.

Hustling is necessary sometimes.

Hustle 24/7 is a fast track to misery.

-

3) You don't need to be ruthless or transactional

99% of the time, acting this way is a giant mistake.

Instead, try these things, which allow you to be successful without being an a**hole.

- Build a tight circle of real friends
- Provide value daily to each other and others
- Help them achieve their goals and grow together

Recognize who helped you get there and say yes to those folks often.

When someone doesn't make an effort to build a real relationship, say a polite ""no"".

You can't be everything to everyone, but you don't have to be a jerk either.

-

4) Money matters, but it's not the ""be-all, end-all"".

Pursuing as much money as possible is a silly goal.

Because money doesn't create joy.

It can certainly be helpful in creating many, many moments of fleeting happiness, but a happy life isn't what I'm after.

My pursuit in life is about joy:

- Having purpose
- Having community
- Helping other people

You can do all of that without $10M or $50M or $100M.

I hope this helps dispel a few myths about building a one-person business.

There's never been a better time to get started.

"Last week, I was named the #1 Global LinkedIn Creator by Favikon.

I'm human, so of course, I feel honored to win. We all love awards.

But there are a few things people should know about me:

1. I got lucky. I started writing on LinkedIn in 2018 before most of the other creators on the list. Good timing is a real thing.

2. It's my job. I have 40+ hours per week to spend on getting better at this craft. Not everyone has that time.

3. I'm childless. My wife and I don't have children by design. That makes it easier to focus and carve out time.

4. I have experience. Before becoming a creator I was an executive at a successful startup, so I have a deep understanding of both marketing and sales.

5. I'm very fortunate. I was raised by great, supportive parents, in a middle-class family, who encouraged me to do anything I wanted.

I say all of these things not to diminish the accomplishment, but simply to provide some context that I think is really important.

Of course, I work hard, spend a lot of time studying and trying to get better, etc.

But, if I were giving out the awards, here are 4 people I would consider:




I love following Dan because he brings practical fitness content to LinkedIn. And he's not a 21-year-old, single guy who diets for a day and gets 6-pack abs. He's in his 40s and is committed to the long-term process of diet and fitness. I learn something each day he writes.




Wes has incredible experience supporting Seth Godin and brought that experience to building Maven, the leading platform for cohort-based coaching programs. Each piece of content she writes is crammed full of executive and startup wisdom.




Dan is wise beyond his years. His content comes across like an ancient philosopher and is equal parts cerebral and tactical. I was a guest on his podcast and he came extraordinarily prepared with deeply thoughtful questions




Madison might be the best writer on this platform. I'm sure there are people reading this who disagree with her, but you'd be missing the point. I would argue she understands her mission, vision, and values better than anyone I've seen on here. And she can articulate it in ways that attract the right people and repels the wrong people. Anyone who wants to write online should study how Madison generates emotion with her words.

There ya have it.

"Making $150k/yr selling products online is really hard.

But, it's much easier when you break it down.

Here's one way to look at it:

$150,000 per year is:

- $12,500 per month
- Which is roughly $417/day
- Which is 9 customers @ $50 each
- That's 400 daily web visitors at a 2.25% conversion

So, the questions to ask yourself is:

How can I generate enough attention to attract 400 daily visitors to my website?

- What should I teach them?
- Where do they hang out online?
- What can I offer to get them to my site?
- How can I help people convert when they get there?

Mind you, answering these questions is difficult.

But it's certainly a better strategy than hoping you make $150k somehow.",post190

1. Write every day: You get significantly better through repetition

2. Try different styles: Try writing, images, and recording to find your groove.

3. Study great creators: There is usually something formulaic about their content.

4. Interact underneath large accounts: Get to their content fast and with value.

5. Choose your character: Are you the leader? The reporter? The evangelist?

6. Give away your knowledge: Host written AMAs, jump on Zoom, organize a webinar.

7. Join forces with relevant people: Find 3-5 people in your niche and support each other daily.

8. Stop the scroll: Doesn't matter if your content is good if people don't stop to read it.

9. Tell people why they should follow you: Your tagline informs your audience of who you are.

10. Keep it simple: If I can't figure out what you do in 2 seconds on your profile, I'm out.

11. Steal from the greats: Never plagiarize. But style? Structure? Words? Get it.

12. Build in public: Want an easy start? Just share what you are working on every day.

13. Teach: If people can learn something from you every day, you'll win in the end.

14. Rule No. 1? Be consistent.

I did it anyways.

- New customers are up 56.4%

- Gross sales are up 48.6%

- Spend per customer is down 9.9%

- You'll start to recognize that you're really talented.
- You'll start to believe in yourself.

Then?

You can suddenly accomplish way more than you thought you could.

That's when stuff gets really fun and you get a little swagger about you.

"4 questions to double your productivity:

(and save 40+ hours per month)


1/ What can I eliminate?

Each week I find:

- Upcoming meetings I shouldn't have booked
- Podcasts I don't need to be on
- Favors that aren't urgent
- And more

I simply ask myself:

""Does this move me closer to my most important goals?""

No: Eliminate
Yes: Move to next question


2/ What can I simplify?

Look for simpler processes or a reduced scope of work.

Like my digital course.

I could have made it an elaborate production, but instead, I recorded videos in one take with no editing.

‚ÄúCan this be simplified?‚Äù

Yes: Simplify
No: Move to next question


3/ What can I automate?

Next, I look for places to insert automation.

An example is my coaching business.

I used to have an elaborate back-and-forth to onboard clients.

Now I use Kajabi + Zapier + Airtable.

‚ÄúCan this be automated?‚Äù

Yes: Automate
No: Move to next question


4/ What can I delegate?

Delegate any work that is leftover, that is less valuable than the time it would take you to do.

Delegate to a VA (or someone on Upwork) using process documents & videos that show them exactly what to do.


5/ What's left?

Once I'm through these questions, there are 4 non-negotiable pieces of work that end up on my calendar:

- Interact on social media for 45-60 minutes
- Go to the gym for 90 minutes
- Write for 90 minutes
- Attend 1 client call


And my normal day ends up looking like this:

- 7:15a to 8:15a: Interact on LinkedIn/Twitter for 45 minutes
- 8:30a to 10:00a: Go to the gym with my wife
- 10:30a to 1:00p: Write and eat lunch
- 1p to 3:00p: Open for a client call

All of this works because I take an approach of knowing what I don't want to do.

"Monetizing social media is about trust.

But it's difficult to build trust with just LinkedIn posts.

That's why it's critical to build something totally different:

A ""Creator Funnel"" for your business.

Your goal is to move your audience from thinking, ""this person is familiar"" to ""this person is someone I trust"".

And when I use the word, trust, I mean they trust in your expertise.

They trust that you know what you're doing in your field of choice.

To deepen that trust, use longer-form content to show your expertise:

- Newsletter
- How-to guides
- Step-by-step videos

For my creator funnel, I encourage people to subscribe to my weekly newsletter.

My goal is twofold:

- Show people how I think at a deeper level (trust)

- De-platform my closest followers to my email list and off of social media.

Not familiar with a Creator Funnel?

"There is hidden income on everyone's calendar.

It's buried deep inside the repetitive tasks you do daily.

And most people never capitalize on it because they are blind to it.

- Do you write weekly?
- Do you project manage weekly?
- Do you create automation weekly?
- Do you document processes weekly?

If the answer is ""yes"" to any of these questions (or many other examples) you can easily turn this into recurring revenue.

It just requires that you pay attention to how you spend your time and create a rigid process.

Steal my process here:",post212
"Should you quit your 9 to 5?

Probably not.

Here's what you should do instead:


1. Check your employee agreement

Can you work on a side hustle while employed?

It's always good to double-check your agreement with your employer first.

If you're good to go, next...


2. Embrace an obsession

When you start by embracing your obsessions, you rarely need any other external motivation.

You wake up each day with an intense desire to become the best in your specific obsession.

So ask yourself this:

‚ÄúWhat am I absolutely obsessed with? What could I research, break down, and share with the world daily, that would feel like play instead of work?‚Äù


3. Acquire unique knowledge

The best way to develop this unique knowledge is by putting maximum effort into exploring your obsession.

For example, there are a million ‚Äúproductivity experts‚Äù and books on building better habits.

But James Clear‚Äôs book, Atomic Habits, stands head and shoulders above the rest.

Why?

Because his obsession with habits led him on a unique journey all his own.

And out of that journey came unique knowledge like:

- Habit Stacking
- Plateau of Latent Potential
- The 3 layers of Behavioral Change

...and more.

Nobody can compete with James, because in a world of boring academic and scientific studies, James translated his obsession into unique knowledge that only he has.


4. Build distribution

Study human psychology, marketing, and persuasion.

Don‚Äôt copy your competition.

Once you understand how to generate attention, set up a simple customer journey that increases awareness, trust, and relationships.


5. Scale using digital media

Take 15-30 minutes at the end of each day to observe what you accomplished or learned that day.

What can you share with your audience that's a uniquely specific learning to you?

Tell stories, use metaphors, show real word examples, share behind the scenes, challenge conventional thinking, etc.

Every piece of content works on your behalf for hours and sometimes even days.

Classic pieces of content have lasted years or even decades. That's the power of media.


TL;DR

1. Check your employee agreement
2. Embrace an obsession
3. Acquire unique knowledge
4. Build distribution
5. Scale using digital media

"I've now built 2 of my 5 income streams past 7-figures.

And I never wrote a single line of code.

Use these 10 steps to do the same (without all of the mistakes):


1/ Eliminate the ""fallacy of expertise""

When you get started, don't worry about ""am I an expert?""

If you do, you'll never get started.

Instead, make a list of your accomplishments, big and small, over the last 2-3 years.

What skills did you learn during this period?


2/ Identify your interests

Inside of the list you just created, will be things you loved doing & hated doing.

Sorry, but you can't scale being miserable.

Choose something you built skills in, that you also enjoy doing/talking about/writing about.

This will be your focus.


3/ Find the ""you"" from 2-3 years ago

Your goal is to find people who are just like you, but much earlier in their journey.

Where do they hang out online? Try places like:

- Reddit
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- FB Groups

If you can't find them, use tools like SparkToro to help.


4/ Create content

Next, it's time to establish credibility.

Here are some easy ways:

- Teardowns
- Newsletters
- Step-by-step guides

Show the people 2-3 years behind you that you understand their challenges & have solved them before.

This will gain you a small following.


5/ Create a service business

A simple coaching business can be your 1st income stream.

An MVP landing page + Stripe or Gumroad to collect payments.

The key? Make the pricing a no-brainer.

You're not looking to get rich here, you're looking to learn.


6/ Promote it

It's unlikely you'll get clients just because you exist.

Instead, find easy ways to promote it.

When your new followers ask you questions, tell them about your coaching business.

When you write content, share a link at the end.

Super simple stuff.


7/ Listen for commonalities

This is a key step to creating your 2nd income stream.

Your goal when coaching is to listen for the most common problems of your students.

- Write down every problem you hear
- Dive deeper to understand them
- Keep a running list

This is the gold.


8/ Build a digital product

Your 2nd income stream is your 1st digital product. Focused on the most common problem above.

Take someone from problem to solution in 60 minutes or less.

Keep it focused.

Single problem ‚Üí single solution

Price it reasonably to build trust.


9/ Raise your rates

With a lower-priced product, you can now increase your coaching rates.

When people want coaching, you can coach.

When they don't, tell them about your digital product.

You now have an offering for different learning styles and price points.


10/ Set up your systems

- Create useful content
- Drive people to the product
- Upsell 1:1 coaching packages

With this simple system it's only a matter of time before you add a 3rd income stream:

- Consulting
- Community
- Physical products
- Cohort-based coaching

Next?

Get started.

Because this is a 5+ year journey documented above.

Good luck!",post219

2. Challenge: They have grown zero social media audience

Solution: Share one daily tip that has helped you solve the problem above.

Do this for 6 months and watch what happens.


3. Challenge: They don‚Äôt have a collection of interested people to sell to

Solution: Create a resource or newsletter that helps solve it.

Put it on a website and drive people there every day.

You'll build a small email list of prospective customers.


4. Challenge: They over-complicate the process (especially the technology)

Solution: Start with the easiest and cheapest technology.

Or just go with whatever you know best.

"In 2021, Netflix saw its market share drop from 65% to 48%.

"A growing LinkedIn audience is an asset to any entrepreneur.

I've added another 103,497 followers in 2022 (so far).

Here are the 6 dead-simple things I did:


1. Built my publishing habit every morning:

In 2022, I'm 194/194 days with at least one piece of content.

I have 3 goals:

- Continue my habit of posting each day.
- Put my name & face in front of people daily.
- Drastically increase brand awareness globally.


2. Repurpose popular content 5x per week

As a reminder, repurposing your content is an incredible strategy.

- 75% of your followers never saw it.
- 80% of your followers won't remember.
- 100% of your new followers never saw it.

Use this to accelerate growth.


3. Link to my newsletter 3x per week

Everyone claims LinkedIn ""hates"" external links.

Maybe.

I've seen about a 30% reduction in impressions, but a 700% increase in CTR (click-through rates).

The improved CTR drastically outweighs the decreased impressions.

I'm averaging 300+ daily new subscribers to my newsletter.

A channel I own.


4. Engage with 6-10 interesting people each week:

I spend a few minutes each day reaching out to people that are doing interesting stuff.

We jump on a short Zoom and get to know each other.

How can I support you? How can you support me? Where can we collaborate?

Make it a habit to build real connections. Not just LinkedIn connections.


5. Comment underneath large accounts:

One of the best ways to gain visibility here is to participate.

- Find interesting, large accounts
- Set up automatic notifications
- Read each of their LI posts
- Add valuable comments
- Engage

It's literally that easy.


6. Improved my ""inspiration"" swipe file:

Writing a lot of content means constantly being inspired.

Here are the tools I use to find that inspiration:

Hypefury - Content templates
Twemex - Find Twitter creator's best Tweets
LinkedIn Save - Save LinkedIn creator's best LI posts.

And that's it.

"4 steps to finding hidden revenue on your weekly calendar:

(literally, anyone can do this)


Step 1: Check your calendar for routine knowledge creation

Find knowledge you share or value that you already create on a routine basis.

For example, part of my content creation process is curating high-quality styles, formats, and structures for Tweets or LinkedIn posts.

Then, I turn them into templates I can use.

This is literally something I'm already doing to help with my own content.

And after talking to a few creator friends, they were blown away by the templates I was creating.

I had a hypothesis that this was something I could offer at a low cost to other creators.


Step 2: Create a cadence for capturing knowledge

Once you identify weekly recurring knowledge, you need a rigid process for capturing the knowledge.

If you're going to productize it for recurring revenue, you can't miss or be willy-nilly.

You must deliver consistently.

I started by strictly scheduling the time to find and create new content templates.

Every Monday at 1:45 pm, I spend 30 minutes finding great content online.

Then at 2:15 pm, I spend 30 minutes turning them into templates I can use and reuse.


Step 3: Repurpose into an affordable recurring revenue model

Take it to the next level by creating a cadence for productizing the knowledge.

I decided to turn my templates into a subscription for creators who are looking to improve their content game.

On the 15th of each month, I create and send these fill-in-the-blank templates to my subscribers.

I add color commentary, show examples, and categorize them.

I've seen people on Twitter copy and paste Tweets and sell that for $500 or $49/mo.

I wanted to do this 10x better for 5x cheaper.

So I created a product that I price at $9/month and gives creators a stress-free way of writing high-quality content at scale.


Step 4: Turn your own problem and solution into sales copy

The best part about selling work you're already doing is knowing exactly why you're doing it.

- You know the problem it solves.
- You know how your solution works.
- You know how it feels to have the solution in hand.

Use the problem to create excellent awareness marketing and the problem & solution as copy for your landing page.

The goal?

"This morning, my 2nd of 5 income streams crossed 7-figures.

Copy these 10 dead-simple steps to do the same:

(without making all of the mistakes!)


1/ Eliminate the ""fallacy of expertise""

When you get started, don't worry about ""am I an expert?""

If you do, you'll never get started.

Instead, make a list of your accomplishments, big and small, over the last 2-3 years.

What skills did you learn during this period?


2/ Identify your interests

Inside of the list you just created, will be things you loved doing & hated doing.

Sorry, but you can't scale being miserable.

Choose something you built skills in, that you also enjoy doing/talking about/writing about.

This will be your focus.


3/ Find the ""you"" from 2-3 years ago

Your goal is to find people who are just like you, but much earlier in their journey.

Where do they hang out online? Try places like:

- Reddit
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- FB Groups

If you can't find them, use tools like SparkToro to help.


4/ Create content

Next, it's time to establish credibility.

Here are some easy ways:

- Teardowns
- Tweet threads
- Step-by-step guides

Show the people 2-3 years behind you that you understand their challenges & have solved them before.

This will gain you a small following.


5/ Build a small service business

A simple coaching business can be your 1st income stream.

An MVP landing page + Stripe to collect payments.

The key? Make the pricing a no-brainer.

You're not looking to get rich here, you're looking to learn.


6/ Promote it

It's unlikely you'll get clients just because you exist.

Instead, find easy ways to promote it.

When your new followers ask you questions, tell them about your coaching business.

When you write content, share a link at the end.

Super simple stuff.


7/ Listen for commonalities

This is a key step to creating your 2nd income stream.

Your goal when coaching is to listen for the most common problems of your students.

- Write down every problem you hear
- Dive deeper to understand them
- Keep a running list

This is the gold.


8/ Build a digital product

Your 2nd income stream is your 1st digital product. Focused on the most common problem above.

Take someone from problem to solution in 60 minutes or less.

Keep it focused.

Single problem ‚Üí single solution

Price it reasonably to build trust.


9/ Raise your rates

With a lower-priced product, you can now increase your coaching rates.

When people want coaching, you can coach.

When they don't, tell them about your digital product.

You now have an offering for different learning styles and price points.


10/ Set up your systems

- Create useful content
- Drive people to the product
- Upsell 1:1 coaching packages

With this simple system it's only a matter of time before you add a 3rd income stream:

- Consulting
- Community
- Physical products
- Cohort-based coaching

Next?

Get started.

‚Üë That's the KEY.

Make your first move today and start working this process.",post248
"The online entrepreneur is a magician.

Want to become one?

Here are 5 things you need to do well:

1. Generate attention:

Creating massive attention around one specific topic gives you incredible leverage in 2022.

The best entrepreneurs are constantly in our social streams with relevant content.


2. Deepen trust:

Short-form social attention should be funneled towards long-form trust-building content:

- A weekly newsletter
- A YouTube channel
- A podcast

This is where you show off your knowledge and build deep trust in your expertise.


3. Build relationships:

Content that deepens trust can be used to navigate readers towards a place where you build relationships.

A private community, weekly event, or Facebook group are all examples of good relationship building.


4. Monetize

Once you have deep relationships, it's much easier to monetize.

People are more likely to buy your products and services if you're focused on their core area of improvement.


5. Deliver

None of this matters if you have bad products and services.

That's why you should deliver 100x what you charge to surprise and delight your customer.


The more of these steps you master, the more you multiply.


I wrote an entire article on maximizing this process.

"Back in 2019, I received a really thoughtful DM from some guy named Austin Belcak.

He had seen me writing on LinkedIn and wanted to help out.

So, he sent me some tips and a PDF on copywriting.

I was so thankful to have someone do that for me, especially because I was struggling to figure out the platform.

A few months later, I reached out to him and asked how I could support his business, and we began a regular Zoom cadence to chat.

That turned into:

- Being a guest on Austin‚Äôs LinkedIn Live event.
- Exchanging LinkedIn recommendations.
- Several great Podcast introductions
- A private community event
- A craft beer exchange
- And more...

This all started because Austin reached out with a value-driven approach to help me.

And then I returned the favor.

This is an example of how you build successful relationships online.

Not asking to ""pick someone's brain"".
Not asking someone to follow you back.
Not dropping your post in a DM and asking for engagement.
Not cold pitching your product or service to someone on LinkedIn.

Being a real, helpful, caring, supportive person.

That's the big ""secret"".

"10 business clich√©s that are lies (or at least misunderstood):


1/ Money doesn't buy happiness

It may not buy happiness, but it buys freedom and flexibility.

The more that you have, the easier it is to say no to things you don't like.

Doing less of what you hate and more of what you like makes you a much happier person.


2/ Follower count doesn't matter

It's not ALL that matters, but it's an indicator that your content is resonating.

And with that, you'll have a better chance to build a business, land a job, find opportunities, meet interesting people, etc.

And that's why most of us are here.


3/ Quality over quantity

Sometimes.

But when you're just starting out in any new endeavor, repetition matters.

So start with quantity to help find the quality.

Then do both.

High output, high quality. Win/Win.


4/ Cheaters never win

Nearly everyone who is someone has cheated in their ascension to the top.

It doesn't necessarily make it right, but it's 100% true.

And unfortunately, that's why we have a lot of poor academics and rich criminals.

Always be moderately skeptical.


5/ The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results

Randomness & chance are at play in every attempt.

My creator buddy, Tony Dinh, posted the same article to Hacker News 4 times with no traction.

Then, on his 5th post, it blew up.


6/ There are no stupid questions

""Stupid"" is a pretty subjective term, but there are questions that can easily be Googled.

If you skip Googling and ask (at work, in life, etc.) you'll be labeled as a liability rather than an asset.

Teaching yourself is a wonderful habit.


7/ Good things come to those who wait

Good things come to those who take action in the short term and stay consistent in the long term.

Waiting and waiting until everything is ""perfect"" will yield the opposite of ""good things"".

It will likely yield nothing.


8/ Work a job you love, and you'll never work a day in your life

I love my job more than anything.

I've transitioned out of executive leadership in tech and into a full-time creator helping thousands of people.

It's still a ton of work.

The most work I've ever done.


9/ If you have faith in yourself, you don't need a Plan B

Again, randomness and chance are at play here.

Build your career like a venture capitalist, not a venture-backed founder.

Have a plan A, B, C, D, E, and F.

Increase your chances, and decrease your risk.


10/ Not everyone was meant to be an entrepreneur

Maybe everyone wasn't meant to build SaaS business, but entrepreneurship?

That CAN be for anyone.

Offer a service, sell an eBook, build a Shopify store, start a side hustle, etc.

Don't let people project their fears onto you.

1/ A focused audience

I chose to focus on one specific avatar: solopreneurs

Solopreneurs grow their businesses online via content marketing & social media.

So, this makes it easy for me to deliver tactical lessons that I know will resonate.

2/ Kept it consistent

I deliver the email every Saturday morning at 8a CST.

I haven't missed in 12 weeks.

People now tell me they look forward to receiving it.

And open rates have stayed consistently between 64% and 67%.

One tip to grow your online audience and business each week.

No fluff.
No nebulous stuff.
No theoretical future-predicting.

Just tactical tips that have actually worked for the person writing it: me

4/ Made it consumable

People are oversubscribed to newsletters.

So many newsletters are too long.
Very few are too short.

Mine can always be read in less than 4 minutes and the lessons can be applied immediately.

That's my promise.

5/ Marketed more effectively

Here‚Äôs 5 steps to getting it right:

1. Nail your persona:

- Who are you talking to, specifically?
- Market --> sub-market --> micro-market.
- The deeper you understand, the more you'll resonate.

2. Small, relevant, ecosystem:

- Stop interacting with 15+ people every day.
- Find 3-5 people that are relevant to your customer.
- Start meaningful conversations underneath their content.

3. Educational content:

- Surface-level stuff doesn't work to establish expertise.
- Teach people how to get from point A to B as easily as possible.

4. Focused distribution:

- Don't try and play on every social channel when you start.
- Pick the one you like and learn the nuances.
- Double down on content that works.

5. Simple monetization:

- Before you build something, look for signals from your audience.
- Build a community, course, coaching business, or whatever.
- Pick one and get started. Not two, not three. Just one.

Start your creator journey like an MVP: minimum viable product.

"When building online you have to go deep.

Not wide.

Here‚Äôs 5 steps to getting it right:

1. Nail your persona:

- Who are you talking to, specifically?
- Market --> sub-market --> micro-market.
- The deeper you understand, the more you'll resonate.

2. Small, relevant, ecosystem:

- Stop interacting with 15+ people every day.
- Find 3-5 people that are relevant to your customer.
- Start meaningful conversations underneath their content.

3. Educational content:

- Surface-level stuff doesn't work to establish expertise.
- Teach people how to get from point A to B as easily as possible.

4. Focused distribution:

- Don't try and play on every social channel when you start.
- Pick the one you like and learn the nuances.
- Double down on content that works.

5. Simple monetization:

- Before you build something, look for signals from your audience.
- Build a community, course, coaching business, or whatever.
- Pick one and get started. Not two, not three. Just one.

Start your creator journey like an MVP: minimum viable product.

Recap:

1. Get specific
2. Network small.
3. Educational content.
4. One core platform to start.

- Now, I‚Äôm D (current state)

- Then grab it for this one-time price reduction

"Making $200k/yr selling a digital product is really hard.

But, it's much easier when you break it down.

Here's one way to look at it...üëáüèª

$200,000 per year is:

- $16.7k per month
- Which is roughly $550/day
- Which is 11 customers @ $50 each
- So, you need 275 daily web visitors at 4% conversion

Mind you, none of those things are easy.

But it's certainly easier than staring $200k in the face with no plan.

I've run this plan with multiple digital products at once.

And I'm happy to help clarify or give some advice.

1. On the 1st of each month, I look at my content from 5 months ago.

4. Now, I have 10 of 20 monthly posts already written.

5. I usually write the other 10 posts in a weekend.

So I Googled, ""How to build a personal brand"".

The first article I found?

Forbes ""Coaches Council"": 14 Steps For Creating An Amazing Online Personal Brand.

To put it lightly...it was pretty bad.

""Connect with your audience.""
""Tell good stories.""
""Have a website.""
""Be intentional.""
""Be authentic.""

Here's the problem...

Most of the information written online today is for SEO purposes.

Now page 1 articles are just keyword soup.

And they aren't really intended to teach or educate.

So instead of Googling more, I decided to do the following:

- Followed people that I admired who were already doing what I wanted to do.
- Joined private groups, took some courses and listened to some podcasts.
- Took action. I learned the most when I stopped Googling and started creating.

Anyone that is an expert in their field, who you admire, didn't get there by Googling.

They got there through learning and action.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can use it üëáüèª

Step 1: Feedback

You must get feedback from as many customers as possible.

- Where do your customers get the most value from you?
- What do they wish they could get more of from you?
- Send a survey or have a simple conversation.
- Don‚Äôt overcomplicate.

Step 2: Iteration

- Develop & expand areas customers want
- Eliminate things they don't want
- Look at what YOU like/hate
- Is there an intersection?
- Double down there

Step 3: Testimonials

- Collect as many testimonials as possible from your happy customers
- Splash written and video testimonials on every page of your website
- This drives conversion from prospect on website --> booked call
- It‚Äôs also a key driver behind price increases
- You need them regardless of level

Step 4: Increase

- You now have important feedback from step 1
- A more valuable operation from step 2
- Social proof from step 3
- Increase prices!

- Market --> sub-market --> micro-market
- The deeper you get, the more you'll resonate.

2. Ecosystem:

- Stop trying to interact with 15+ people every day.
- Find 3-5 people that are relevant to your customer, and play in their space.

3. Content:

- Surface-level stuff can work, but ultimately your audience wants to learn.
- Teach people how to get easily from point A to point B in the shortest amount of time.

4. Distribution:

- Trying to play on every social channel keeps you from getting started.
- To start, pick the one you like and double down.

5. Monetization:

- You could build a community or a course or a coaching business or whatever.
- Just pick one and get started with one. Not two, not three. Just one.
- You can add later.

I made a list of all the people I had been admiring from afar.

And I started engaging with them instead.

Not surprisingly, I started connecting with interesting people.

- Those connections turned into friendships.
- Those friendships led to introductions.
- That became connections...

I continued to write. They started paying attention.
I continued to engage. They paid even more attention.
I wrote even more. I got even more engagement.

Now? I have an enormous network.

A group of people I can:

- Get constructive feedback from
- Share a frustration with
- Bounce an idea off of
- Count on for support
- Get advice from

That network feeds my growth.
That growth seeds new networks.

You need to understand that this game isn't a solo game.
It's a network game.

That's why I'm thrilled that 700+ people joined the waitlist for my new private community of creators, called Audience & Income.

Interesting people like other interesting people. The good news? ""Interesting"" is subjective. You don't need to climb Mt. Everest. Maybe you're an amateur interior designer? A group of people will find that interesting. Talk about it.

When you talk about it, have something unique to say. What makes you different? Why does your style stand out? What do you believe in that other designers don't?

It's the internet. Vanilla doesn't fly.

3. Solve your own problems in public:

Why are you doing your own design? Maybe professionals are too expensive or don't have that unique style you're looking for?

Create content that shows people how you overcame those problems. If you have them, it's likely other people do too.

4. Then, help others solve theirs:

Work with someone in public. Show people your results. Bet on yourself underneath your own brand.

Do this consistently & you'll grow a supportive group of followers who find you interesting, appreciate your perspectives, & use your products to solve their problems.

Not wide.

Some examples below.

1. Persona: who are you, specifically? Get into one area of expertise and go really deep. The deeper you get, the more potential customers.

2. Ecosystem: don't try to interact with 15+ people every day. Find 3-5 people that are relevant to your target customer, but have related expertise.

3. Content: surface-level stuff might work, but ultimately your audience wants to learn. Teach people how to accomplish something specific.

4. Distribution: choose your platform with intention. Trying to play on every social channel keeps you from getting started. Pick one you like and double down.

5. Monetization: you could build a community or a course or a coaching business or whatever. Just pick one and get started with one. Not two, not three. Just one. You can add later.

Think about starting your personal brand like an MVP (minimum viable product).

You don't need to.

Why?

Because there is no competition when the brand is you.

The easiest way to create a ""you"" brand is by talking about things from your perspective.

From your experience.

Here's a simple way to get started:

Step 1: Accomplish something.

Step 2: Document everything you did.

Step 3: Find people that want to do that thing.

Step 4: Share exactly how you accomplished it.

Step 5: Repeat.

Once you've shared your very specific wisdom and experience, it starts to happen.

People start to follow and interact with all of your content because they enjoy you specifically.

This is why one piece of viral content doesn't matter.

Some thoughts on why ‚¨á

Virality is less important than you think.

That story that got 1M views doesn't matter if it's not related to your brand.

Getting people to click the follow button is easy.

Getting people to come & engage with your content each day is hard.

Getting people who engage to start buying from you is even harder.

Those two things don't happen because you have a viral piece of content.

They happen because your content is consistent, on-brand, high quality, & informative.

Relevant.

Need help staying on brand? Here are 2 steps of my system:

1. Develop ""pillars"". What are the core must-have's of what you do?

Example: For me, personal branding is about persona, ecosystem, content, distribution, and monetization.

2. Create ""core concepts"" for each pillar. Core concepts are strong opinions related to those pillars.

A few of my examples:

- Persona: No brand, no control.
- Ecosystem: Deeper connections not wider.
- Content creation: Experience over expertise.
- Distribution: Choose platforms with intention.
- Monetization: Give first, then ask.

Having pillars and core concepts keep you focused.

When you stay on message you stay relevant every day.

There were lots of talented people there.

Most of them were in entry-level roles or slightly above.

Just 11 years ago.

Now?

- Founder & CEO of Ahura AI
- Founder & CEO at MealPass
- Founder & CEO at CloserIQ
- Chief Customer Officer at Doctor
- Chief Operating Officer at Curalate
- Chief Commercial Officer at Phamily
- VP of Sales & CS at Fundera
- VP of Sales & CS at Teachable
- VP of Customer Success at Platterz
- Global VP of Growth at Knotel
- Head of Growth at PatientPing

Pretty impressive.

So‚Ä¶.

When you‚Äôre screwing around at work‚Ä¶not taking it seriously.

Just remember.

You‚Äôre messing up in front of future executives.

When you‚Äôre working hard, taking things seriously, and doing well?

You‚Äôre building your future with an incredible group of people.

Choose wisely.

"Don't believe everything you hear.

If you do, you'll miss golden opportunities.

Instead, make small bets & evaluate for yourself. Examples:

1. I was told you couldn't make a lot of money consulting. Specifically, I was told by many people that it's a ""lifestyle"" business.

Instead of taking this at face value, I made a 1-page website & promoted it a few times on LinkedIn.

I landed some clients.

They paid well.

They liked the work I did for them.

I invested in a better website. More clients.

More marketing. More promotion. Even more clients.

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

2. I was told you ""cannot sell on LinkedIn"".

Instead of believing this, I documented my journey in a lite version of The LinkedIn Playbook.

Sold a few by promoting it.

Got some really nice feedback & testimonials.

Updated it. Promoted it some more. Made more sales. Got more testimonials.

Now, it's on pace to be a 100k+ course.

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
_________

In both of these examples, I didn't start by going ""all in"".

I decided to test the statements made by others to see if they were true.

They weren't.

So...

1. Identify opportunities
2. Make small bets with minimal investment
3. Track what works
4. Invest a bit more
5. Continue tracking your success
6. Double down on what continues to work

Don't believe everything you hear.

"It's Monday. 

It's a new week. 

Many of us will go back to sharing our professional tips on LinkedIn.

I'll likely participate in some of that.

But, the events of the past few weeks are certainly not behind us.

They are not behind me.

I think that, while many of us get back to our normal sharing and business tips, it's critical that we continue to push diversity and inclusion forward on a regular basis.

That we continue to fight to end racial discrimination.

That we continue to battle bias in the workplace.

That we close the wage (and wealth) gap.

That we don't put all of this on the back burner just because one week has closed and another has opened.

So...

You'll see an increased focus on that from me.

I hope that we all continue to donate our money, donate our time, and donate our resources...

That we don't just talk about it.

We deliver action.

We're at a really crucial crossroads.

Let's make sure we don't fail as we have so many times before.

Have a wonderful week.

"I wrote an article on Monday to address what's going on.

Then, I made a choice to stay off of LinkedIn this week...

I wanted to amplify the voices of people of color.

Sharing sales and leadership tactics during this time seems extraordinarily tone-deaf.

But, with Thursday Night Sales approaching, I realized that we have an opportunity to amplify those voices even louder.

So, I'm posting today to share how we're changing our Thursday Night Sales event this week.

Rather than being hosted by me,, and, we'll be turning over the microphones to 3 extraordinarily talented Black sales leaders:

"Make sh*t simple. 

A true story.

In May of 2013, I was promoted to my first Director-level role.

I was tasked with launching a new product at ZocDoc. But...

I was terrible at negotiating contracts.

Like, awful.

I sat down with the Chief Legal Officer at my company and he walked me through an agreement, talking about the negotiation points.

When he glanced over at me, he could tell my head was spinning.

Like it was yesterday, I can remember him smiling and leaning back in his chair.

The next sentence is the one that sticks out:

""Ok, Justin. Imagine you are running a lemonade stand...""

He then proceeded to teach me each point like I was a Kindergartner.

I leaned in hard because this was the first time someone made contract negotiation a bit easier for me to understand.

That's what real intelligence looks like.

Being able to explain complex things in simple ways.

Forget complicated jargon
Forget fancy acronyms and what not
Forget trying to impress others with your lingo

Just explain it in a way that I can understand easily.

Works in legal
Works in marketing
Works in sales demos
Works in customer success

I'm not embarrassed. We all suck at stuff.

Isn't it amazing to have something explained in a way you can understand it?

Help someone in that same way today.

This is the TOP reason people don't start building their brand or business.

There are over 7 billion people on this planet...

The market will tell you whether or not you have value.

Follow these 5 rules to get started:

Rule 1: Build credibility by doing interesting things and then documenting them
Rule 2: Promote on platforms where there is a built-in audience
Rule 3: Measure your engagement and figure out what is resonating
Rule 4: Participate in useful conversations with other people in your audience
Rule 5: Reply to DMs and comments

"I don't care about being rich. 

The only thing I care about is owning nearly 100% of my time.

Sure, money helps. 

But...

It's no longer wage X hours = income

It's products X sales = income

One eats my time.

One requires me to ask someone else for a raise.

One requires me to work more hours for more money.

Who raises their hand a lot in training.

Who saddles up to the top performers to pick their brains.

Who dives a level deeper than most.

LinkedIn is amazing for building relationships, landing jobs, and creating a personal brand.

But how do you *actually* do that?

What are the steps you need to take to go from zero to hero on this platform?

What actions *really* lead to more relationships, more jobs, and more leads?

I'm hanging out with the one and onlytonight to break it all down for you.

A year and a half ago, we both had zero brand on this platform. The same as many of you!

Today we have a combined audience of 190,000+ here on LI.

We use this platform to generate leads for our businesses, to get jobs for our clients, and to build relationships with some pretty amazing people!

Tonight, we're going to take you through our journeys step-by-step.

We'll break down:

+ Why we decided to get started on LinkedIn

+ How we came up with our first pieces of content

+ How we overcame the fear of ""putting ourselves out there""

+ How we stayed consistent for the first 30+ days

+ How we optimized our profiles to create a flood of opportunities

+ How we've built relationships with amazing people

You can tune in tonight at 5pm EST / 2pm PST right here on LinkedIn Live!

"Not getting any traction with your LinkedIn posts?

You need to PULL your prospect in.

Here's how you do itüëáüèª 

1. Start with the hook line that gets them to click ""see more"".

What's a hook line? It's two lines above this one - the one you just read that got you to click.

2. Make sure you have a lot of white space.

Our brains don't like long, dense paragraphs.

We don't like them in cold sales emails.

We don't like them on LinkedIn.

We just don't.

Still here?

Likely, because this is easy to read.

3. Send them somewhere to learn more

If your prospects like your content, they will want to learn more. Send them directly there!

It takes a consistent creation process.

Want 3 helpful tips? Read onüëáüèª

1. Install the Pocket extension in Chrome

Save articles of interest and revisit for inspiration when writing. I write each weekend.

2. Document using the notes app on your phone

What is one thing you taught someone today? I'll bet others are looking to learn that same thing. Write it down! Post about it.

3. Curate a better Twitter feed.

Add people who inspire you. Subtract those who suck your energy.

Carve out a few minutes per day to look for inspiration.

Take a screenshot of tweets you like and make quick notes.

Expand on them or take a different viewpoint.

"It's really hard to start building your personal brand...

If you're afraid of ridicule.

Are you?

Because if you are...

Each time you hear, ""That's silly...not gonna work""

Or...

""Ridiculous. You look really stupid...""

Or my favorite...

""That's a waste of time.""

You're going to crumble.

Because, when you:

Try to create something new.
Build an amazing brand.
Think outside the box.

90% of the people you know won't understand.

And I've found that when people don't understand something, they are highly likely to ridicule it.

Or ridicule YOU.

When this happens, just smile and say, ""I feel really good about what I'm doing.""

All of our businesses have been impacted by this.

A few weeks ago, I got to chatting with my friend, and we kicked around an idea of hosting a fun, low-key, open-to-the-public virtual happy hour.

We'd talk sales, careers, life, whatever.

All over a beer or drink of your choice.

Our plan was to simply provide some fun in this weird and challenging time.

Well.
